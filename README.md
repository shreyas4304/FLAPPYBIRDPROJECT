Compile all three classes (FlappyBird.java, GamePanel.java, Bird.java)
 and run FlappyBird as the main class. The game window should open,
 and you can control the bird's altitude by pressing the spacebar to jump.
 The pipes will scroll from right to left, and the game will end if the bird collides with any pipe.
